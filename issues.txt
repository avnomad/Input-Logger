Issues:

-input logging functionality is still basic.
-currently buts a spurious 'null' entry in the end of json log file to simplify 
 code, but this should be eliminated.
-strange behavior is exhibited when running under x64 and writing with pen 
 tip with no side buttons pressed. This behavior is different for each pen and 
 doesn't seem to appear with Bamboo (maybe some other strange things).
-color assignment is not done in a predictable way.
